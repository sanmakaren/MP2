# Set seed value of random number generator here. This is in order to get

# of 76? For no other reason than 76 is one of my favorite numbers:

You will be submiting an entry to Kaggle's [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/){target="_blank"} by fitting a **multiple regression** model $\hat{f}(x)$.

# EDA

Read in data provided by Kaggle for this competition. They are organized in the `data/` folder of this RStudio project:

```{r}
training <- read_csv("data/train.csv")
test <- read_csv("data/test.csv")
sample_submission <- read_csv("data/sample_submission.csv")
```

Before performing any model fitting, you should always conduct an exploratory data analysis. This will help guide and inform your model fitting. 

## Look at your data!

Always, ALWAYS, **ALWAYS** start by looking at your raw data. This gives you visual sense of what information you have to help build your predictive models. To get a full description of each variable, read the data dictionary in the `data_description.txt` file in the `data/` folder.

Note that the following code chunk has `eval = FALSE` meaning "don't evaluate this chunk with knitting" because `.Rmd` files won't knit if they include a `View()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#View(training)
#glimpse(training)

#View(test)
#glimpse(test)

```

## Data wrangling

As much as possible, try to do all your data wrangling here:

```{r}

#variables:   Categorical - BldgType,  Numerical - GrLivArea
#log10_GrLivArea + BldgType + OverallQual + HalfBath + Foundation + SaleCondition")

training <- training %>% 
  select(Id, GrLivArea, BldgType, SalePrice, OverallQual, HalfBath, Foundation, SaleCondition)

```

# Minimally viable product

## Model fitting







## Create your submission CSV

```{r}
submission <- sample_submission %>% 
  mutate(SalePrice = mean(training$SalePrice))

write_csv(submission, path = "data/submission_mvp.csv")
```


## Screenshot of your Kaggle score

Our score based on our submission's "Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error" was 0.42918.

# Due diligence

## Model fitting
```{r}
training <- training %>% 
  sample_frac(1) %>% 
  mutate(fold = rep(1:5, length = n())) %>% 
  arrange(fold)

df = data.frame(fold = numeric(0), RMSLE = numeric(0))

model_1_formula <- as.formula("SalePrice~ GrLivArea + BldgType")

  

for(j in 1:5){
  pretend_training <- training %>% 
    filter(fold != j)
  pretend_test <- training %>% 
    filter(fold == j)
    
  # Fit model on pretend training
  model_1 <- lm(model_1_formula, data = pretend_training)
    
  fitted_points_1 <- model_1 %>%
    broom::augment(newdata = pretend_training)
    
  predicted_points_1 <- model_1 %>%
    broom::augment(newdata = pretend_test)
    
  rmsle_hat = MLmetrics::RMSLE(y_pred = predicted_points_1$.fitted, y_true = predicted_points_1$SalePrice)
    
  df[nrow(df) + 1,] = list(j,rmsle_hat)

}
```

## Estimate of your Kaggle Score
```{r}
mean(df$RMSLE)

## Create your submission CSV

```{r}
predict_test <- model_1 %>%
  broom::augment(newdata = test)

test <- test %>% 
  mutate(SalePrice_hat = predict_test$.fitted)


```

```{r}

  mutate(SalePrice = predict_test$.fitted) %>%
  select(Id,SalePrice)


write_csv(submission, path = "data/submission_due_diligence.csv")

# Reaching for the stars

## Model fitting

Use log10 saleprice to get RMSLE
```{r}
training <- training %>% 
  mutate(log10_SalePrice = log10(SalePrice),
         log10_GrLivArea = log10(GrLivArea),
         log10_OverallQual = log10(OverallQual)
         )


```


## Model fitting

```{r}

training <- training %>% 
  sample_frac(1) %>% 
  mutate(fold = rep(1:5, length = n())) %>% 
  arrange(fold)

df2 = data.frame(fold = numeric(0), RMSLE = numeric(0))
  

for(j in 1:5){
  pretend_training <- training %>% 
    filter(fold != j)
  pretend_test <- training %>% 
    filter(fold == j)
    
  # Fit model on pretend training
  model_2_formula <- as.formula("log10_SalePrice~ log10_GrLivArea + BldgType + OverallQual + HalfBath + Foundation + SaleCondition")
  model_2 <- lm(model_2_formula, data = pretend_training)
    
  fitted_points_2 <- model_2 %>%
    broom::augment(newdata = pretend_training)
    
  predicted_points_2 <- model_2 %>%
    broom::augment(newdata = pretend_test)
  
  pretend_test <- pretend_test %>% 
    mutate(
      log10_SalePrice_hat = predicted_points_2$.fitted,
      SalePrice_hat = 10^log10_SalePrice_hat
    )
    
  rmsle_hat = MLmetrics::RMSLE(y_pred = pretend_test$SalePrice_hat, y_true = pretend_test$SalePrice)
    
  df2[nrow(df2) + 1,] = list(j,rmsle_hat)

}
